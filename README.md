## 🔑 API Integration

This app uses the **OpenWeatherMap API**.

2. The app makes a fetch request to OpenWeatherMap API and displays:
    - City name & country  
    - Temperature  
    - Weather description  
    - Humidity and wind speed  
    - Weather icon (from OpenWeatherMap or custom icons)

---

## 📱 Responsiveness

The UI is fully responsive using CSS media queries and Flexbox. It adapts to various screen sizes from desktop to smartphones for an optimal experience everywhere.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- 📍 Add "Use my location" feature with Geolocation API  
- 🕒 Show 5-day or hourly forecast using OpenWeatherMap's forecast API
